## 4. Try to create a directory named test
mkdir test

## 5. Go to the general home directory (should contain folders named after each user)
cd /home

## 6. Go to your home directory
cd ~

## 7. Go back to the general home directory (located "just above")
cd ..

## 8. Go again "just above", you should be back to the root directory
cd ..

## 9. Go directly to your home directory (named after you). It should be a very simple command, which take no name as parameter of the path
cd

## 10. Try to create a directory named test
mkdir test

## 11. Go into this new directory
cd test

## 12. Check your current location 
pwd


# Exercise 2: Create, Rename, copy, delete

## 1. Go to your home directory (should be named after you, you might be there by default)
cd james_gnansia

## 2. Check your current location
pwd

## 3. Create a folder linux_ex_1
mkdir linux_ex_1

## 4. Go into this folder
cd linux_ex_1

## 5. Create an empty text file named [first_name]_[last_name].txt 
vim james_gnansia.txt

## 6. Create a folder notes
mkdir notes

## 7. Move your text file into this folder
mv james_gnansia.txt notes/

## 8. Rename the text file by appending the current year james_gnansia_2023.txt
mv james_gnansia.txt james_gnansia_2023.txt

## 9. Make a copy of this folder, name it notes_2022
cp -r notes/ notes_2022

## 10. Delete the first folder (notes) using the verbose option
rm -rv notes

# Exercise 3: Create and run a script
## 1. Create a script script_1.sh in the folder linux_ex_1
vim script_1.sh

## 2. In the script, write the commands that would output the following:
##    Script running please wait ...
##    Done.
echo "Script running please wait ..."
echo "Done."

## 3. Quit editing and save the script

## 4. Display the content of the script (using a command, not from an editor)

## 5. Run the script
source script_1.sh

# Exercise 4: Accessing or modifying a file : permissions and root privilege

# (c) Display the file content
cat credentials
# 3. Change the permissions back to read and write for all users
