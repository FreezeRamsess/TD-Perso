# Exercice 1 :  Clone a Git repository

## 3. Using only command-line in your Linux shell, clone it to a local repository.

{bash}
Copy code
pwd
Try to create a directory named test
{bash}
Copy code
mkdir test
Go to the general home directory (should contain folders named after each user)
{bash}
Copy code
cd /home
Go to your home directory
{bash}
Copy code
cd ~
Go back to the general home directory (located "just above")
{bash}
Copy code
cd ..
Go again "just above", you should be back to the root directory
{bash}
Copy code
cd ..
